## APP purpose

Students mostly interact with text in their daily life. Most students take printed notes, and it often becomes
very difficult to keep track of large paper work, so it can cause unnecessary pain to students. We thought converting
printed notes into a digital (scanned) version could make storing paperwork easy. This has led us into the idea of making
an app that can help people scan their printed notes. If time permits we can extend the app to detect handwritten text 
and convert them to digital text. Also uploading these text files to cloud platforms will really help students in organizing and maintaining their text.

## Overview

Textify is a mobile app that converts a text image to a doc or a pdf, this might sound super common but we want to make
it better by allowing the users to be able to store the converted text and organize them into folders, lectures and allow
users to share those in cloud platforms. Since college students tend to have a lot of handwritten text, we also intend to be
able to scan handwritten text and be able to save them for later use instead of saving old notebooks.
